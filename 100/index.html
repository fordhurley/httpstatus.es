            &#8220;This means that the server has received the request headers, and that the client should proceed to send the request body (in the case of a request for which a body needs to be sent; for example, a POST request). If the request body is large, sending it to a server when a request has already been rejected based upon inappropriate headers is inefficient. To have a server check if the request could be accepted based on the request's headers alone, a client must send Expect: 100-continue as a header in its initial request and check if a 100 Continue status code is received in response before continuing (or receive 417 Expectation Failed and not continue).&#8220; &mdash; <a class="reference" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes#100">wikipedia</a>

            &#8220;The client SHOULD continue with its request. This interim response is used to inform the client that the initial part of the request has been received and has not yet been rejected by the server. The client SHOULD continue by sending the remainder of the request or, if the request has already been completed, ignore this response. The server MUST send a final response after the request has been completed.&#8220; &mdash; <a class="reference" href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt">ietf</a>
